# KIR VBA

These files were in use during the years starting around 2004. 

The primary goal of this project was to automate the task of data download from a system that wasn't user friendly. Well if you consider clicking over a list of option to get one piece of information, then in this sense it was user friendly. However, getting a bunch of information from was a real pain. 

## Why `Excel+VBA`? 

That was the only tool available.

## How it worked?

It started the application, and emulated the user interaction with the application. 

It might be interesting or even useful if you want to achive something similar using only windows system calls from VBA.
